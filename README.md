<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
This is a mini project in which I have written algorithms in Python to solve a 3x3 Sliding Puzzle using State Space Search Algorithms such as
* Breadth First Search
* Best First Search
* A Star Search

## Usage
Give the input for a 3x3 Board in the code and call the appropriate function in order to solve the board using a specific algorithm.
<br/>
<br/>
Finally run the code using

```py
python 3x3_slide_puzzle.py
```
